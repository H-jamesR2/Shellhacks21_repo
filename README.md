Submission: "AutoBot"

##Inspiration

Our inspiration for building this chatbot was being able to work with interesting, practical technologies and a chatbot that is front-facing and will be likely to interact with customers with the advent of the internet and automation piqued our interests.

##What it does

Our chatbot is able to query input parameters from customer responses and will select the relatively appropriate response to give the customer more information about their auto-needs or direct them to more detailed sources of information such as AutoNation's company websites.

##How we built it

Our Graphical User Interface was built using Java (front-end) and Our Bot's logic and the way it handles the associated training data was built using Python, PyTorch, and Natural-Language-Processing techniques.

##Challenges we ran into

Some of our challenges that we ran into were: -Learning the role NLP plays with regards to programming the logic of our chat bot. -Going through pytorch documentation and applying what's needed. -Choosing which language to build our front-end that is convenient for our use-case.

##Accomplishments that we're proud of

-Proud that we we're able to dynamically learn and apply our knowledge that we learned during the Hackathon such as chatbot methodologies (Amazon Lex) -Proud that we we're able to communicate relatively effectively and setup workflows despite being first-hackthon-project-submitters.

##What we learned

-We learned the importance and value of setting up a team-workflow whether it be through 'github repositories' or 'google cloud repositories' and having constant communication to account for potential changes or potential challenges. -We learned the importance of picking the appropriate tech-stack in increasing our coding output.

##What's next for Autobot

-Finish GUI + Bot Logic integration... -Autobot integration with Google Maps API to assess customer's nearest location and direct bot's response logic according to AutoNation nearest provider. -Autobot integration with React or other technologies to be able to create a Hybrid-Mobile App that pairs well with web-dev or mobile-app methodologies.
